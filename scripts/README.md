# ⚙️ Scripts

This folder contains production-ready Python scripts and utilities that power the project.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Core Scripts** → Main logic of the project, organized and reusable.  
- **Utilities** → Helper functions (data loaders, preprocessing, etc.).  
- **Automation** → Batch jobs, training pipelines, or monitoring tools.  

## Guidelines
- Keep scripts modular → each script should do **one thing well**.  
- Add docstrings and inline comments for maintainability.  
- If an experiment is stable, move it from `/notebooks` to `/scripts`.
