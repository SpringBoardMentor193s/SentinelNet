What patterns do you observe in network traffic? Why is it challenging to detect intrusions?


When looking at network traffic, clear patterns appear. Most harmless traffic follows predictable behaviors,
like stable packet sizes, regular intervals, and common protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP. 
In contrast, harmful traffic often shows unusual signs: sudden spikes in requests, like in DoS or DDoS attacks, 
repeated login attempts from brute force attacks, or irregular flows that donâ€™t match typical usage. 
For instance, probing attacks may create many short-lived connections to different ports, while botnet traffic can show strange communication patterns with external servers.

The difficulty in spotting intrusions comes from the overlap between harmless and harmful patterns.
Attackers often mask their actions to imitate normal traffic, making it hard for basic rule-based systems to find threats. 
For example, a legitimate file transfer and a harmful data theft can look very similar at the packet level. 
Plus, the large amount of network traffic means that unusual activity can easily blend in with normal variations.

AI is crucial because it can learn fine distinctions within large datasets and apply that knowledge to unfamiliar threats.
By examining correlations and timing patterns, machine learning models help reveal intrusions that people or traditional systems might overlook. 
This ability to adapt is vital in today's quickly changing cybersecurity environment.
