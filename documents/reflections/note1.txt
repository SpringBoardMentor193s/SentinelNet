Why AI is Critical in Cybersecurity & What Excites Me about Building SentinelNet?

In today’s digital world, cybersecurity acts as a primary defense against increasingly complex cyber threats.
Traditional systems that rely on signatures can find it difficult to identify new or changing attacks. 
This is where AI proves essential. Machine learning models can recognize patterns from large amounts of network data, detect anomalies, and continually improve, making them crucial for proactive intrusion detection.

What excites me most about building SentinelNet is the chance to combine rigorous academic study with real-world effects.
Using datasets like NSL-KDD offers a clean and structured base for initial learning and testing, which is useful for refining models with a limited number of features. 
At the same time, CICIDS2017 adds realism and complexity by including over 80 features that reflect diverse protocols and modern attacks like Heartbleed, botnets, and infiltration, closely resembling actual network conditions.

Working on SentinelNet allows me to engage with the entire machine learning lifecycle.
This includes data ingestion and preprocessing, feature engineering, and training and tuning useful classifiers like Random Forests or SVMs. 
The idea of transforming raw traffic data into precise, real-time security alerts is incredibly motivating.

AI’s ability to grow and streamline defense systems will be essential for future cybersecurity. 
Developing SentinelNet not only sharpens my technical skills but also has the potential to make networks safer and more durable. 
That’s what truly drives me: blending AI innovation with meaningful protection.
