Project statement and goals

Develop a real-time AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that analyzes network traffic 
to identify and differentiate between normal (benign) activities and malicious (suspicious) ones.

Use machine learning models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM to classify network flows.
This system will generate alerts or logs for any detected anomalies.

Implement key modules, including:

- Dataset acquisition and exploration  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering and selection  
- Model building and training  

Utilize publicly available datasets, such as NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017, to train and test the system. 
Also, prepare a presentation or report that summarizes the work.
