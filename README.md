# SentinelNet – AI-Powered Intrusion Detection System

# 📌 Overview

SentinelNet is a machine learning–driven Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that monitors and analyzes network traffic to detect cyber threats in real time.
The system learns from historical datasets and classifies connections as legitimate or suspicious, enabling proactive defense against attacks.

With a focus on both data exploration and model experimentation, SentinelNet serves as a foundation for building more advanced AI-based intrusion detection tools.

# 🎯 Key Goals

Gain insights into network traffic behavior and attack patterns.

Implement data preprocessing and feature engineering for intrusion detection.

Train and evaluate multiple classification models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, etc.).

Benchmark performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Design a system capable of alerting abnormal network activities.

Document findings with visualizations and reports.

# 📊 Datasets

SentinelNet currently supports two benchmark datasets:

NSL-KDD Dataset → Dataset Link

CICIDS2017 Dataset → Dataset Link

Both datasets provide labeled network traffic that distinguishes between normal behavior and multiple attack types.

# 🧩 Project Modules

Dataset Loading & Exploration – Summarizing data distributions and attack categories.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding.

Feature Engineering – Selecting the most influential features for classification.

Model Training & Validation – Applying ML algorithms to detect intrusions.

Performance Evaluation – Comparing models using metrics and confusion matrices.

Alerting & Reporting – Logging anomalies for further security analysis.

# 🛠️ Technology Stack
