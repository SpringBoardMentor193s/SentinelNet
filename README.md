#  SentinelNet: AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

##  Overview
SentinelNet is an AI-powered **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** designed to identify malicious network traffic and potential cyber-attacks in real time.  
By leveraging advanced **machine learning techniques**, SentinelNet classifies traffic as **normal** or **suspicious**, enabling faster threat detection and response.
