# 🔐 SentinelNet  
AI-powered *Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)* for detecting malicious traffic and cyber-attacks in real time.  

---

## 📌 Overview
SentinelNet leverages *Machine Learning* techniques to classify network traffic as normal or malicious.  
It is designed to help identify intrusions, anomalies, and attacks in computer networks, using datasets like *NSL-KDD*.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🚀 Detects intrusions in real time  
- 📊 Trained on *NSL-KDD dataset*  
- 🤖 Machine Learning based classification models  
- 📂 Modular project structure (analysis, scripts, notebooks)  
- 📝 Clear documentation and reproducible experiments
