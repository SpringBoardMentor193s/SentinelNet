SentinelNet – AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
Overview:

SentinelNet is an AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to identify malicious network traffic and cyber-attacks in real time. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to classify network traffic as normal or suspicious, based on historical data.

Goal:

The main goal of this project is to develop a system capable of detecting network intrusions in real time and generating alerts for anomalies by analyzing traffic data.

Features:

✔ Data preprocessing and feature extraction from network traffic
✔ Multiple machine learning models for anomaly detection
✔ Performance comparison using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
✔ Real-time detection and alert generation
✔ Scalable design for integration with enterprise security systems
