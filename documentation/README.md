# ðŸ“– Documentation

This folder contains all the written references, guides, and explanations that go along with the project.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Technical docs** â†’ Detailed descriptions of the methods, algorithms, and design decisions.  
- **Reports & write-ups** â†’ Any formal reports, research notes, or background explanations.  
- **References** â†’ Links, citations, or external resources that helped during development.  

## Why This Exists
Good code without documentation is like a map without labels.  
This folder is meant to make sure anyone (including future-you ðŸ‘€) can understand how and why the project works.
