About datasets:-

NSL-KDD Dataset

Number of Features:
The NSL-KDD dataset contains 41 features per record 

Types of Attacks:
It includes attacks categorized primarily into four types:
Denial of Service (DoS)
Probe (reconnaissance)
User-to-Root (U2R)
Remote-to-Local (R2L) 

Differences / Characteristics:

NSL-KDD is an improved and cleaned version of the older KDD-99 dataset. It removes redundant records, addressing biases present in the original data 
While simpler and smaller, it can still suffer from outdated attack scenarios and limited realism (simulated rather than real traffic).


CICIDS2017 Dataset

Number of Features:
CICIDS2017 provides more than 80 features per network flow, extracted via tools like CICFlowMeter

Types of Attacks:
It includes a wide and more modern array of attack types:
Brute Force FTP and SSH
Denial of Service (DoS)
Distributed DoS (DDoS)
Infiltration attacks
Web-based attacks (including XSS, SQL Injection)
Heartbleed
Botnets
Port scanning 

Differences / Advantages:
Contains realistic network traffic, generated over a 5-day period with simulated normal user behavior and coordinated attacks 
More traffic diversity, labeled flows, various protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, email), and comprehensive metadata make it far more representative of modern threats.
Significantly larger and richer than NSL-KDD, with modern, real-world relevance.
