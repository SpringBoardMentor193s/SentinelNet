# ðŸ““ Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter/Colab notebooks used for experiments, prototyping, and data exploration.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Exploratory Analysis** â†’ First looks at datasets, visualizations, and sanity checks.  
- **Model Training Experiments** â†’ Trying out different algorithms, tuning, and comparisons.  
- **Proof of Concepts** â†’ Quick tests before writing production code.  

## Notes
- Notebooks are for **experimentation** â€“ donâ€™t expect them to be as clean as the final scripts.  
- Keep outputs (plots, metrics, notes) visible so others can follow the workflow.  
- If a notebook proves important â†’ its core logic should later move into `/scripts`.
