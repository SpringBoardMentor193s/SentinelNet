### Reflection: Why is AI critical in cybersecurity, and what excites me about building Sentinelnet?
Cybersecurity is one of the biggest challenges of the digital age. With the rise of data, online services, and smart devices, traditional security systems struggle against evolving and sophisticated attacks. Static, rule-based methods are no longer enoughâ€”this is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes essential.
What excites me about building SentinelNet is the opportunity to apply AI to a real-world challenge that directly impacts digital safety. It allows me to work with datasets like NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017, bridging academic knowledge with practical applications. The project not only helps me strengthen skills in data analysis and machine learning but also gives me a chance to contribute to creating safer, smarter, and more resilient cybersecurity systems that can protect people and organizations from evolving threats.
