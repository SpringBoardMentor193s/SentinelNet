# Why is AI critical in cybersecurity, and what excites me about building SentinelNet?

Cybersecurity has become one of the most urgent challenges of our digital age. The scale and sophistication of modern cyberattacks are growing faster than what traditional security systems and human analysts can handle. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes critical. Unlike static rule-based systems, AI can continuously learn patterns from massive amounts of network data, identify anomalies in real time, and adapt to evolving threats. It not only accelerates detection but also minimizes false positives, ensuring that security teams focus their attention on genuine risks. By automating analysis and response, AI provides speed and scalability that are impossible to achieve manually, making it indispensable for protecting today’s highly connected systems.

What excites me about building SentinelNet is the opportunity to apply AI to a meaningful, real-world problem. SentinelNet is not just about monitoring traffic; it’s about creating a smart, proactive defense mechanism that anticipates threats before they cause damage. Working with datasets like NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017 allows us to train models that can recognize both classic and emerging attacks, bridging the gap between research and practical application. The integration of advanced AI models like LLaMA adds an innovative dimension, enabling natural language understanding of threats and intelligent alerting. For me, the excitement lies in being part of a project that has the potential to strengthen digital resilience and make cybersecurity smarter, faster, and more reliable. Building SentinelNet feels like contributing to the future of secure digital infrastructure.

# What Patterns do I observe in network traffic ? Why is it challenging to detect intrusions ?

When examining network traffic, distinct patterns become visible in how data flows across systems. Normal traffic typically follows predictable structures: web browsing generates repeated HTTP or HTTPS requests, DNS queries resolve domain names regularly, and file transfers show larger, continuous data packets. User behaviors also create recognizable trends—for example, working hours may show heavy email and browsing activity, while nighttime traffic is lighter and often automated. Protocol usage, packet size distributions, and connection frequencies together form a baseline of what “normal” activity looks like in a network.

However, detecting intrusions within this traffic is highly challenging. Malicious activities such as port scanning, denial-of-service attempts, or data exfiltration are often designed to mimic normal behavior, making them hard to distinguish. Attackers may use encryption, stealth techniques, or low-and-slow strategies to blend in and avoid detection. Furthermore, legitimate traffic is highly variable due to diverse applications, cloud services, and dynamic user behaviors, which means defining a strict threshold for anomalies often leads to false positives. With the massive volume of network data generated every second, even small deviations can be overlooked. These challenges highlight why intrusion detection requires advanced methods like machine learning, anomaly detection, and contextual analysis to effectively identify threats
