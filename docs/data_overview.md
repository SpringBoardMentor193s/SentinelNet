--NSL-KDD Dataset--   

-- Released in 2009, as an improved version of the older KDDâ€™99 dataset.  
-- Each row represents a network connection record.  
-- Contains 41 features, divided into:  
    -- Basic features (protocol, service, duration).  
    -- Content features (failed login attempts, number of file creations).  
    -- Traffic features (connections in a time window).  
-- Labels: either Normal traffic or one of four main attack categories:  
    -- DoS (Denial of Service)  
    -- Probe (information gathering)  
    -- R2L (Remote to Local)  
    -- U2R (User to Root)  
-- Dataset size: small to medium, easy to load into memory and train models on.  
-- Best use: Prototyping, and testing basic intrusion detection models.  




-- CICIDS2017 Dataset --  

-- Released in 2017 by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC).  
-- Data collected from a realistic network environment over 5+ days.  
-- Each record is a network traffic flow, not just a simple connection.  
-- Contains 80+ flow features, such as:  
    -- Packet count, byte rate, average flow duration, header info.  
-- Labels: either Benign traffic or a wide range of modern attacks:  
    -- DDoS, Brute Force, PortScan, Infiltration, Botnet, Web attacks, etc.  
-- Dataset size: very large (several GBs of CSV files).
