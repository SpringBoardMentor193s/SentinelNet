# ðŸ“Œ What is NSL-KDD?

The NSL-KDD dataset is an improved version of the KDDâ€™99 dataset, which was originally created for the 1999 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program.
It is widely used for network intrusion detection system (NIDS) research.

The improvements over KDDâ€™99:

Removed redundant records (avoids bias toward frequent attack types).

Provides a more balanced training and testing set.

Includes multiple test sets with different difficulty levels.

# ðŸ“‚ Files in Your Dataset

KDDTrain+.txt / KDDTrain+.arff â†’ Full training dataset.

KDDTrain+_20Percent.txt â†’ A smaller (20%) subset for faster experiments.

KDDTest+.txt / KDDTest+.arff â†’ Standard test dataset.

KDDTest-21.txt â†’ A more challenging test set with attack types not present in training (to test generalization).

# ðŸ“‘ Data Structure

Each record represents a network connection with 41 features + 1 level:

Basic Features (duration, protocol_type, service, src_bytes, dst_bytes, etc.)

Content Features (number of failed logins, root access, etc.)

Traffic Features (connections to same host, error rates, etc.)

Level â†’ Either normal or an attack type.

# ðŸš¨ Attack Categories

Attacks are grouped into 4 main categories:

DoS (Denial of Service) â†’ e.g., smurf, neptune, teardrop.

Probe (Surveillance/Scanning) â†’ e.g., satan, ipsweep, nmap.

R2L (Remote to Local) â†’ e.g., guess_passwd, ftp_write.

U2R (User to Root) â†’ e.g., buffer_overflow, rootkit.
